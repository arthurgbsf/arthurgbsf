<h3 align="left">Hello everyone!ðŸ‘‹</h3>

My name is Arthur Godinho Barbosa, I'm 33 years old, and I'm thrilled to share my career transition journey with you all. I have a bachelor's degree in Production Engineering and recently decided to pursue my passion for technology and venture into the field of programming.

Since I was a child, I have always been fascinated by computers, video games, and everything that technology can offer. Today, I feel excited to learn programming languages, create interactive websites, and contribute to the development of innovative solutions. I believe that technology is a powerful tool that can positively transform the world, and I am eager to play my part in this process.

Furthermore, being a father to JoÃ£o Pedro is one of the greatest blessings in my life. Parenthood has taught me values such as responsibility, patience, and the ability to handle unpredictable situations. I take pride in being an example to my son, showing him the importance of pursuing our dreams and working hard to achieve them.

This profile is a way for me to share my projects and contributions, as well as connect with other developers and learn from their experiences. I am open to collaboration opportunities and joint learning, so if you'd like to exchange ideas or collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

I am excited about this new phase of my career and ready to face new challenges and grow as a developer. My programming journey is just beginning, but I am fully committed to expanding my knowledge and skills in this field.

Thank you very much!

Arthur Godinho Barbosa
